# Analyssis of the UK traffic accidents.

## Data

Road accidents unfortunately are sad part of our life. In the paper below I will try to look into the data and find what are variable contributing to the amount of casualties in road accidents in UK. The data comes from the Kaggle website and can be found here [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales).

Data set consist only information collected from police reports therefore minor accidents are not included. Since data set is rather big (432 MB) I will use only small subset describing accidents between 20012 and 2014.

Main objective is to understand how amount of casualties in accidents is dependent on conditions described by variables in the data set.
